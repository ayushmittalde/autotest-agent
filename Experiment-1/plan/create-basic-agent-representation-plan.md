## Section 3: Selected Representation & Justification

### 3.1 Primary Representation: Hybrid Approach

After evaluating all options, I recommend a **hybrid approach** combining:

1. **Gherkin/BDD Scenarios** (Primary)
2. **Activity Diagrams in Mermaid** (Visual workflow)
3. **Sequence Diagrams in Mermaid** (Component interactions)
4. **State Diagrams in Mermaid** (State modeling)
5. **Decision Tables** (For operation selection logic)

### 3.2 Justification for Hybrid Approach

#### Why Gherkin/BDD Scenarios as Primary?

1. **Direct Test Case Derivation**: Gherkin scenarios are executable specifications that can be directly transformed into automated tests using frameworks like Cucumber, SpecFlow, or Behave.

2. **Requirement Traceability**: Each scenario can be tagged with requirement IDs (e.g., @FR-QA-001), providing explicit traceability from documentation to tests.

3. **Verification Support**: The Given-When-Then structure makes it easy to verify that test cases correctly reflect the documentation:
   - **Given**: Preconditions (verifiable setup)
   - **When**: Actions (verifiable operations)
   - **Then**: Expected outcomes (verifiable assertions)

4. **Human-Readable**: Non-technical stakeholders can review and validate scenarios, ensuring correct interpretation of requirements.

5. **Automation-Friendly**: Scenarios can be implemented as automated tests, supporting continuous integration and regression testing.

6. **Industry Standard**: BDD is a well-established practice with extensive tool support and community knowledge.

#### Why Supplement with Mermaid Diagrams?

1. **Visual Complement**: Diagrams provide visual understanding that complements textual scenarios.

2. **Process Clarity**: Activity diagrams clearly show the workflow of agent creation and execution.

3. **Interaction Modeling**: Sequence diagrams show how components interact during agent operations.

4. **State Management**: State diagrams model the system's state transitions during agent lifecycle.

5. **Tool Integration**: Mermaid diagrams are markdown-compatible, version-controllable, and can be embedded in documentation.

#### Why Decision Tables?

1. **Complete Coverage**: Decision tables ensure all operation combinations are tested for the calculator agent.

2. **Combinatorial Testing**: Helps identify required test cases for different input combinations.

3. **Logic Verification**: Makes the calculation logic explicit and verifiable.

### 3.3 Advantages Over Alternative Representations

**Compared to State Diagrams Only**:
- Gherkin provides more detailed action specifications
- Better suited for test automation
- More accessible to non-technical stakeholders

**Compared to Activity Diagrams Only**:
- Gherkin provides executable specifications
- Better traceability to requirements
- More structured format for test case generation

**Compared to Use Case Specifications Only**:
- Gherkin is more concise and focused
- Better tool support for automation
- Visual diagrams add clarity

**Compared to Decision Tables Only**:
- Gherkin handles workflows and sequences better
- More comprehensive coverage of system behavior
- Combined approach covers both procedural and decision logic

### 3.4 How Representations Enable Test Case Derivation

#### Gherkin Scenarios → Test Cases:
1. Each scenario becomes a test case
2. Given steps → Test setup/preconditions
3. When steps → Test actions
4. Then steps → Test assertions
5. Scenario Outlines → Parameterized tests

#### Activity Diagrams → Test Paths:
1. Each path through the diagram → Test case
2. Decision points → Test variations
3. Parallel flows → Concurrent test scenarios

#### Sequence Diagrams → Integration Tests:
1. Each sequence → Integration test scenario
2. Messages → Assertions on component interactions
3. Alternative flows → Error handling tests

#### State Diagrams → State Transition Tests:
1. Each transition → State transition test
2. State coverage → Ensure all states are tested
3. Invalid transitions → Negative tests

#### Decision Tables → Combinatorial Tests:
1. Each column → Test case
2. All combinations → Complete test coverage
3. Don't care conditions → Test optimization

### 3.5 Verification and Traceability Mechanism

**Traceability Matrix**:
```
Requirement ID → Gherkin Scenario → Test Case → Test Result
```

**Verification Process**:
1. Each functional requirement has at least one Gherkin scenario
2. Each Gherkin scenario maps to an executable test
3. Each test includes requirement ID in tags
4. Test execution reports show requirement coverage
5. Documentation changes trigger test review

**Bidirectional Traceability**:
- Forward: Requirement → Scenario → Test → Result
- Backward: Test Failure → Scenario → Requirement → Documentation
