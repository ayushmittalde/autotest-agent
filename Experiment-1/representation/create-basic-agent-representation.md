    And the system should display an error message
    And the error should indicate that numeric input is required
    And the calculation should not proceed

  @Edge-Case-5 @Error-Handling @Divide-By-Zero
  Scenario: Division by zero error handling
    Given the Calculator Block is configured for "divide" operation
    When the user provides inputs: a=100, b=0
    And the user runs the agent
    Then the system should detect division by zero
    And the system should display an error message
    And the error should indicate that division by zero is not allowed
    And the agent should handle the error gracefully

  @Parameterized @Multiple-Operations
  Scenario Outline: Execute Calculator agent with various operations and values
    Given the Calculator Block is configured for "<operation>" operation
    When the user provides inputs: a=<value_a>, b=<value_b>
    And the user runs the agent
    Then the agent should execute successfully
    And the system should display the result <expected_result>

    Examples:
      | operation | value_a | value_b | expected_result |
      | multiply  | 5       | 3       | 15              |
      | multiply  | 10      | 10      | 100             |
      | add       | 20      | 30      | 50              |
      | add       | 100     | 50      | 150             |
      | subtract  | 50      | 20      | 30              |
      | subtract  | 100     | 25      | 75              |
      | divide    | 100     | 5       | 20              |
      | divide    | 50      | 2       | 25              |

  @Boundary-Testing
  Scenario Outline: Execute Calculator with boundary values
    Given the Calculator Block is configured for "<operation>" operation
    When the user provides inputs: a=<value_a>, b=<value_b>
    And the user runs the agent
    Then the agent should handle the boundary case correctly
    And the result should be <expected_result> or an appropriate error

    Examples:
      | operation | value_a | value_b | expected_result | notes            |
      | multiply  | 0       | 100     | 0               | Zero operand     |
      | multiply  | 1       | 999     | 999             | Identity         |
      | add       | -10     | 10      | 0               | Negative numbers |
      | subtract  | 5       | 5       | 0               | Equal operands   |
      | divide    | 0       | 5       | 0               | Zero dividend    |
      | divide    | 100     | 0       | ERROR           | Division by zero |
